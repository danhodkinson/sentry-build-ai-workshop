# User State Provider Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive user state management system for the education platform that tracks course enrollments and favorites locally between navigations. This state persists until page refresh or user logout.

## Features Implemented

### 1. UserStateProvider Context

**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/contexts/UserStateContext.tsx`

- **Local State Management**: Manages user enrollments and favorites in localStorage, keyed by user ID
- **Automatic Persistence**: State is automatically saved to and loaded from localStorage
- **User-Specific**: Each user has their own isolated state
- **Session-Based**: Clears when user logs out or page refreshes

#### Key Functions:
- `isCourseFavorited(courseId)` - Check if a course is favorited
- `isCourseEnrolled(courseId)` - Check if user is enrolled in a course
- `toggleFavorite(course)` - Add/remove course from favorites
- `enrollInCourse(course)` - Enroll user in a course
- `unenrollFromCourse(courseId)` - Remove user from a course
- `updateCourseProgress(courseId, progress)` - Update course completion progress

### 2. Custom Hook

**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useUserState.ts`

Simple hook for accessing the UserStateContext with proper error handling.

### 3. Enhanced CourseCard Component

**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/components/courses/CourseCard.tsx`

#### New Features:
- **Heart Icon**: Red heart icon in top-left corner of course thumbnail
  - Empty heart when not favorited
  - Filled red heart when favorited
  - Smooth hover animations
- **Smart Enrollment**: Uses local state instead of API calls
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate visual updates when favoriting/enrolling

#### Interactions:
- Click heart icon → Toggle favorite status
- Click "Enroll" button → Add to user's enrolled courses
- All changes are immediately reflected in the UI

### 4. Updated Pages

#### MyCoursesPage
**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/MyCoursesPage.tsx`

- Now pulls enrolled courses from local state
- Shows progress bars for each enrolled course
- "Remove" button to unenroll from courses
- Real-time updates when courses are added/removed

#### FavoritesPage
**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/FavoritesPage.tsx`

- Displays all favorited courses
- Fetches full course data from API and filters by favorited IDs
- Shows empty state when no favorites exist
- Real-time updates when courses are favorited/unfavorited

#### CoursesPage
**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/CoursesPage.tsx`

- Simplified to remove old enrollment tracking
- All enrollment state now managed by UserStateProvider
- Cleaner component with fewer API calls

## Data Structure

### UserProfile Interface
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  enrollments: UserEnrollment[];
  favoritesCourseIds: string[];
}

interface UserEnrollment {
  id: string;
  courseId: string;
  course: Course;
  enrolledAt: string;
  progress: number;
}
```

## Storage Strategy

- **Key Format**: `userProfile_{userId}` in localStorage
- **Automatic Sync**: Changes immediately saved to localStorage
- **Isolation**: Each user has separate state
- **Cleanup**: State cleared on logout

## User Experience Flow

### Favoriting a Course:
1. User clicks heart icon on any course card
2. Heart immediately turns red and fills
3. Course appears in "Favorites" page
4. State persists across navigation

### Enrolling in a Course:
1. User clicks "Enroll" button on course card
2. Button shows loading state briefly
3. Button changes to "Enrolled" with checkmark
4. Course appears in "My Courses" page
5. Progress tracking available

### Navigation Between Sections:
- **"All Courses"**: Comes from database (unchanged)
- **"My Courses"**: Shows locally enrolled courses
- **"Favorites"**: Shows locally favorited courses

## Integration Points

The system integrates seamlessly with existing:
- Authentication system (user-specific state)
- Course fetching from database
- Existing UI components and routing
- Sentry error tracking

## Benefits

1. **Instant Feedback**: No waiting for API calls
2. **Offline Capability**: Works without internet for favoriting/enrolling
3. **Performance**: Reduced server load and faster interactions
4. **User Experience**: Smooth, responsive interactions
5. **Privacy**: Data stays local until user chooses to sync

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Syncing local state with backend when online
- Importing existing user data on login
- Adding more user preferences and settings
- Progress tracking and completion certificates
